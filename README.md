# Logging in Python

This repo contains examples to play around with logging in Python.  Generally when setting up logging, it is a 'stop-start' cycle and you lose valuable
time.  This script contains quick runnable examples for you to play around with logging and hopefully come up with a good configuration quicker.

Logging is a really well-designed aspect of multiple languages.  Understanding them properly will also teach you good design practices.  Getting a feel
of how logging works is very easy with a language like Python.  The same principles apply to other languages like Java
